  <h1 class="h1">Paste Removal</h1>
  If you accidentally uploaded sensitive info to a paste and would like it removed, you can contact me.<br>
  <br>
  Pastes are only available to those with the link, however there is no protection beyond that.
  <br>
  The best way to contact me is via discord, but you can also email for a paste removal:
  <a href="mailto:paste-removal@ajg0702.us?subject=Paste%20Removal%20Request" class="text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-500 hover:brightness-110 underline">
    paste-removal@ajg0702.us
  </a><br>
  <br>
  Make sure to tell me which paste you want removed! Note that I will only remove pastes if there is potentially sensitive content.
